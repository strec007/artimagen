artimagen (0.4rc3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * 0.4rc3: Added wrapper for C, added example of usage in C. Also, added
    move_by function to the CSample class.

  Earlier version not packaged:
  
  * 0.4rc2: Two serious bugs fixed. These were the reason, why the previous
    version crashed in Windows.

  * 0.4rc1: The first usable version.
