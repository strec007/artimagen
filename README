VERY BRIEF DESCRIPTION:

The Artificial SEM Image Generator (artimagen) is a library that can generate
artificial scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of various samples,
including gold-on-carbon resolution sample, or some semiconductor structures.
Numerous effects that appear in real SEMs are simulated (noise,
drift-distortion, edge-effect, etc.), which enables assessment of imaging,
metrology or other techniques that work with SEM micrographs. Unlike the real
SEM images, the artificial images exhibit defined types and amounts of these
effects, which is their key advantage. 

The Artificial SEM Image Generator has been developed by Petr Cizmar at the U.S.
National Institute of Standards and Technology. The first version of the
generator was written in C to evaluate the ISO-candidate
image-sharpness-calculation techniques. Later, the Artificial SEM Image
Generator become needed for other applications as well and support for new kinds
of samples was added to the generator. In order to make the generator more
flexible, it was rewritten to C++. The users now may take advantage of the
modular object structure of the program.

The scientific background of this software is described in the following
publications:

INSTALLATION:

Prerequisites: artimagen depends on libtiff and fftw3 libraries.

This program uses the standard GNU Autotools toolkit, the installation procedure
is standard:

./configure
make && make install

In order to compile libartimagen as a shared library, use 
"./configure --enable-shared" instead of "./configure". 
However, it is not recommended, since shared libraries must be compiled as the
Position Independent Code, which is in case of this library (with use of the
gcc-4.3.3 compiler) producing significantly less optimized code. :-(
